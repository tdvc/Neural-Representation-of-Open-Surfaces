## Installations

In order to use the code, different packages are required. Specifically, [PyGEL](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/projects/GEL/PyGEL/) and [libIGL](https://libigl.github.io). Depending on your system, these libraries can be installed via pip by using the following commands:

```
pip install PyGEL3D
```

and 

```
python -m pip install libigl
```

Alternatively, you can build the libraries yourself. For the PyGEL library a guide is provided [here](https://github.com/janba/GEL) and for the libIGL library, a guide is [here](https://github.com/libigl/libigl-python-bindings).

Moreover, PyTorch is required, which can be installed from [here](https://pytorch.org). Lastly, a couple of standard packages are needed, which can be installed by running the following line inside the directory of this code:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 
In order to use this code, you need to split your files into a training set and a test set. Then you should place the training meshes inside the train folder under experiment -> your experiment -> data -> train. The same thing goes for the test meshes, which should be put into the test folder at the same location as the train folder.

Note: It is assumed that the meshes are aligned on beforehand (This can be done manually, using landmarks or simple ICP). Moreover, it is assumed that the meshes have been centered around the origin and scaled in such a way that they fit inside the unit sphere. Lastly, the files should be triangle meshes in .obj file format.

### Train and Inference
It is possible to train two different kinds of networks. One network that learns two signals: SSDF and UDF and another network which approximates the GWN. To train the SSDF network, simply go into the folder "your_experiment" and run: 

```
python ../../train.py "your_experiment" "ssdf"
```

If you want to train the GWN network, just replace "ssdf" with "gwn". 

Similarly, if you want to do inference, go into the folder "your_experiment" and run: 

```
python ../../test.py "your_experiment" "ssdf".
```

Also, just replace "ssdf" with "gwn", if you want to do inference for the gwn based network.

### Interpolations
If you want to interpolate between two different meshes, go to "your_experiment" -> "interpolations" and create a .txt file called "interpolation_samples.txt". In this file, you write on each line the names of the meshes, which you want to interpolate between. E.g: 

Mesh1,Mesh2<br>
Mesh3,Mesh4

Then you run the interpolations by going to "your_experiment" folder and running: 

```
python ../../multiple_interpolations.py "your_experiment" "ssdf" "test" n
```

Here n is the number of interpolations including the original meshes. 

### Configurations
If you want to change the configurations for your experiment e.g. the number of epochs, the number of points sampled each for each shape etc., go into the "cfgs" folder, find the file "default.yaml" and change the parameters.
